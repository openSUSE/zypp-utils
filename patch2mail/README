patch2mail
~~~~~~~~~~

patch2mail checks zypper (zypp-checkpatches-wrapper on openSUSE <= 10.3)
for available updates and sends a mail to root if any patches are
available.

Usage is very simple: just install the RPM :-)
It comes with the script in /etc/cron.daily and sends the mail to root.

If you want to install this script manually, follow the %install section
in patch2mail.spec ;-)
